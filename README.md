# CubeIntersection
The CubeIntersection solution consists of two projects, a library (CubeIntersection) that handles the problem logic and a test project (CubeIntersectionTests) that tests the implemented functionalities.
To solve the problem, the CubeIntersection project has defined two classes:
1. Vector: Class of vectors that has the necessary mathematical tools to solve the problem and model points on Cartesian axes.
2. Cube: Class that models a cube and has the required functionalities of the problem (Determine if two cubes collide and calculate the intersected volume of two cubes).
Two classes were also defined to do the tests:
1. VectorTests: to test the features of Vector
2. CubeTests: to test the Cube functionalities
